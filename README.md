# Requirement refering to Wolt's github
https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-summer-intern-2022

# Instruction to build and run the project
1. Install Maven following the instruction at https://maven.apache.org/install.html. This should help to get all the dependencies on Maven central repository and few from Spring.
2. Unzip the project, change directory to root directory at _wolt-summer-intern-22_.
3. Use **_mvn package_** to build the project.
4. Change directory to _target_.
5. Use **_java -jar wolt-summer-intern-22-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar_** to run the build.
6. Test the API with any application you want, I would suggest Postman because it is quite easy to use in such case.
7. The API endpoint is **/deliveryfee**. The full Url running at local machine is **localhost:8080/deliveryfee**.
